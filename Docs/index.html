    <p Id="bio">Growing up in Austin and having been born into a family of musicians it was natural for 
    me to spend thirty years on the road, on stage, and in music schools. Along the way, a natural 
    love of languages and logic led to programming and coding. The design of engaging and 
    interactive sites and applications is what occupies my energies today.</p>
    
    <p Id="bio2">Seems hard to believe today, but I first laid my hands on an Apple computer in central Austin
        in 1980.</p>
    <p Id="bio3">In a marketplace flooded with developers, my unique offering is a highly evolved and varied 
     aesthetic sense, tinged with humor and warmth.</p>
